in theory if you are on Linux and want to make fuse a service:

1. launch 'python register_fuse_as_service.py'
 in case your path to services files is not '/etc/systemd/system/', use it like this:
 'python register_fuse_as_service.py <path_to_services_folder>'

2. run 'sudo systemctl daemon-reload'

3. run 'sudo systemctl enable fuse.service'

4. run 'sudo systemctl start fuse.service'

TO STOP THE SERVICE:
run 'sudo systemctl stop fuse'

TO RESTART SERVICE
run 'sudo systemctl restart fuse'

TO CHECK STATUS OF SERVICE
run 'sudo systemctl status fuse'

better status:
sudo systemctl status fuse -l
