we can start flask servers from cmd
we can specify port and app to start(??)  'flask run -p=50010'

we need to specify 'flask run --host=0.0.0.0' to make it visible for LAN
we need to specify what app to start, for us right when launching:
    set FLASK_APP=Main/hello.py & flask run


for now it looks like a valid windows command:
set FLASK_APP=Main/hello.py & flask run --host=0.0.0.0 -p 5001



to create venv:
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

SO FAR for docker how-to this link was more useful than entire internet
https://blog.logrocket.com/build-deploy-flask-app-using-docker/

i do it having desktop docker launched opened in background to rebuild img
 docker image build -t mscebec/simplest_microservice .

to run
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d mscebec/simplest_microservice

docker stop [container id]   (where con. id is from docker ps)
